We wanted to have a playlist that actually resonated with our taste and something that 
                            was not only based upon a learning model but took in account our actual feelings and moods. Hence we cam up with Soul Train, this is our shot at making sure that the playlist we curate for you reflect the type of music you want and the type that would go with your mood. Enjoy.

The data was acquired via Spotify API calls and the models are TensorFlow sequential networks. Since the models were individually trained on different pieces of the data, they can tell you not only which mood a song conveys, but also to what degree (for example, 64% happy, 14% chill) which was pivotal in arranging seamlessÂ gradients.</center></h5>
